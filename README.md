# Invertor-Button

Micro-Python code to interface between a OEM Toyota Invertor latched button to a after market invertor remote line that only works with a momentary switch.

This uses a RPi Pico, a step down converter (12v > 3.3v), and a 12v relay switch to complete the circuit on the remote line
